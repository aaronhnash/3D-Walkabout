# Overview

Welcome to my first ever attempt at Unity!

The game isn't much to look at now, I've mostly just made a character that can move around an environment and collide with objects. Given how robust the engine is, it should be relatively easy to expand and make actual levels. When it's more complete, this game will be a 3D platformer-style game, where the user is capable of moving blocks or other objects. Until then, it's just a 3D Walkabout! Like, uh, like the name. 

Unfortunately, due to my inexperience with C#, most of what I wrote is near verbatim from other sources that I found online. I've documented every such case. I mostly wrote this lovely bit of coding to familiarize myself with Unity, given that people often simulate robotics using Unity or Unity-driven engines. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used the Unity Hb development environment to edit objects placement, and Visual Studio Code to code the individual C# scripts.

I used C# during this project along with some default Unity libraries. 

# Useful Websites

Here's a list of every tutorial that I pulled code from to experiment with.

# Future Work

Since most of the actual code here was pulled from tutorials and edited only slightly, I wll come back to this once I know more about C# so that I can actually finish the game. 

* Add moveable objects
* Enable raycasting to pick up/manipulate objects
* Make a demo level
